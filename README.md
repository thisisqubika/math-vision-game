# Math Vision

Vision Pro POC based on WWDC happy beam demo

> TODO's:
- Better questions, not just +, harder questions
- Create the concept of LEVEL, so user can select first what level he want's to play, and the balloon speed should depend on that. If level is higher, user
should have less time to complete the challenge
- Countdown animation looks weird
- Sound: Removed all. We might want to download some ones from the internet and create some type of AudioService
